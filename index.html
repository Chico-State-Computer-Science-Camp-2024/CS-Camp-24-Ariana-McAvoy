            Meet the crystal jelly! 
            <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Graceful and nearly transparent, this jelly has long, delicate tentacles. It can expand its mouth when feeding to swallow jellies more than half its size. When disturbed, it gives off a green-blue glow because of more than 100 tiny, light-producing organs surrounding its outer bell. This jelly is harvested for its luminescent aequorin, used in neurological and biological experiments to detect calcium.

            Cool facts:
            <br>
        </p>
            - A crystal jelly can live more than two years on exhibit. Our aquarists are careful not to allow conditions to become too crowded, as this jelly has been known to cannibalize other jellies.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Scientists have created “green mice” by inserting the GFP gene from the crystal jelly into the mice. The animals then glow green when hit by blue light. The glowing protein is a widely used biological highlighter that helps scientists find and study genes more quickly.
